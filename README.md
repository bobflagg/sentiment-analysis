# Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification

In the last several years thousands of research papers have appeared about sentiment analysis and text classification, developing many approaches, including lexical-based, supervised machine learning, and hybrid methods.  In this repository I'll try to track some of this recent work, compare approaches, and implement some of the most promising methods in Python.
